#order-food:

-- Some words to tell you, my friends:

This one, I did it with framework nextjs. It's kinda unfamiliar to me. Because of the folder arrangement and it also stands for the endpoints API. I feel that it's like a combination of react.js with node.js (i meant mern) but in mvc model, lol.

This project focuses on choosing products, adding some topping options and quantity then make a purchase. And user can see the progress of delivery through the order status. 

The admin can login, add more pizzas, topping, set prices, and publishes new products and have the rules to set the status progress of an order after purchasing.

==== If you want to test an admin functions, please login as (user / password): admin / admin.

Anyway, I did learn lots of things. And if I have to tackle one of next.js project in the future, I'm quite confident because I have done it before, as one of my project.

Thank you for reading!
